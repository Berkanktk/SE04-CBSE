# Test Location
Two tests is created for collision detection which can be found under:   
`Collision/src/test/dk.sdu.mmmi.cbsecollisionsystem/` 

**How they work:**  
Two entities are created were some locations are predefined and then added to the world. If these entities get too close to each other, a collision is detected. 

1. Test for collision
2. Test for no-collision
